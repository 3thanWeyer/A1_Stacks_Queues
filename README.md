## Description  
This assignment implements **stacks** and **queues** using **linked lists** as the underlying data structure. The goal is to understand the fundamental operations of stacks (LIFO - Last In, First Out) and queues (FIFO - First In, First Out) and how they can be efficiently implemented using linked lists.
